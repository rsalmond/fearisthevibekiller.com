Not to perform rage or discharge it, but to finally learn what it\u2019s here to teach us and how to work with it.\n\nJoin myself and @maraleegilbert  and @thyme.space this Wednesday evening for a 90-minute live workshop exploring the power of rage as a teacher \u2014 through somatic practice, energy teachings, and herbal wisdom to work with, not against your rage.\n\n\ud83d\uddd3 Wednesday Dec 17\n\u23f0 7pm EST \u00b7 90 minutes\n\n\u2192 Somatic practices\n\u2192 Energetic teaching (the realms of rage)\n\u2192 Herbal wisdom to support your process \n\n\ud83c\udfa5 Replay included\n\ud83c\udf81 Bonus gift + early access to our Temple of the Burning Heart sacred rage retreat for those attending live\n\nY\u2019all know where to sign up \ud83e\udd0d\n\n#sacredrage",
