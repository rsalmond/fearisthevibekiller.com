Which I find rare in the spiritual world, often folks are highly gifted but not embodied in their human lives. \n\nAmanda supports seekers, sensitives, and cycle-breakers as they move through awakening, reclamation, and identity reconstruction. Her signature container, Reclamation, guides clients through releasing old systems, regulating new ones, and building a self capable of holding clarity, intuition, and purpose.\n\nPlus she has an amazing sense of humour which is the cherry on the cake. \n\nI can\u2019t wait to see you \n\nThank you \nThank you \nThank you \n\nCheck out her offerings @amanda.elemental \n\nand of course if you are lucky we will get her to offer this workshop again next year to the 2027 cohort of Fire Keepers \n\nXo Kim + Amanda \n\nimage from Pinterest",
