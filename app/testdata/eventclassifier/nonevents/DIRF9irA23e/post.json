I spent years in advertising and club DJing, chasing what I thought success was \u2014disconnected from my body and truth.\n\nGetting sober 7 years ago shifted things. A traumatic experience took me deeper, and I threw myself into trauma work (which, in hindsight, I DO NOT ever recommend doing so aggressively).\n\nA wild spiritual awakening followed \u2014 complete with premonition dreams, mystical experiences I couldn\u2019t explain, and an accidental mediumship reading. I left advertising and have been stepping into this work ever since. \n\nNow, I guide others home to themselves through energy work, channeling, and soul remembrance.\n\nAs a half Palestinian woman, I believe healing is a radical act\u2014 and part of building a more loving, just world.\n\nGlad you\u2019re here \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc\n\nIf you\u2019re curious to know more, drop a comment or shoot me a DM if something resonates. \n\n#spiritualawakening \n#spiritualhealing \n#healingjourney \n#energyworker \n#lightworkersofinstagram",
