We\u2019ve booked two true masters of their craft to hold this space for us, and we ain\u2019t into hyperbole (at least not today). ATTILA THE SPUN is a local DJ widely recognized for his deliciously inventive, melodic genre-mashing AND his ruthlessly danceable beats. Follow that with a Sound Healing offered by NATASHA \u00c1INE\u2013a consistent, powerful, and respected healer long-standing in our community\u2013and you can expect a night that will move your body along with everything that\u2019s ready to move within you. \n\nAll the details are below. Tell everyone you know.\n\nTHE SCHEDULE IS:\n7:30 - 8:00 pm | Doors Open \n8:00 - 8:15 pm | Opening Circle \n8:15 - 10:30 pm |  DANCE\n10:30 - 11:00 pm | Sound Bath & Integration\n\nINTRODUCING ATTILA THE SPUN\n@attila_the_spun has been moving dance floors for 15 years, formerly as a club DJ in Waterloo. Focusing primarily on house and techno, he seamlessly sprinkles in bits of other genres, so it\u2019s not unusual to hear garage, electro, or jungle woven into his sets.
