  "caption_text": "October 2018\u2026 my friend invited me to a \u201cspecial kind of party\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty different, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll like it\u201d she said. \n\nI walked up to a brick church, into a room with wooden floors and a wall full of mirrors. There were musicians improvising music in time to the creaks of the floorboards. Dancers of all ages filled the room, kids were playing tag and laughing, seniors were throwing their bodies across the floor and jumping through the air. There were shrieks, howls, puddles of humans with an occasional limb poking out. Couples were dancing on their feet as if they were in a bed. \n\nLater on a DJ took over and metamorphosed this sensitive cocoon space into a living creature, soaring through peaks and valleys of sound. I was overwhelmed yet enthralled. \n\nI sat at the edge of the room for almost an hour taking it all in. Once I finally built up the courage to participate, I felt like I was learning to dance again. I was asking my body \u201cwhat do you want?\u201d It guided me to new shapes and forms I didn\u2019t know I could achieve.\n\nThis event was called Pollinate, and over the last seven years I have attended around a dozen iterations of it, meeting so many lifelong friends and sharing deeply intimate experiences with them on the dancefloor. Every single time I learn how to dance again. It\u2019s safe to say that my life has been changed for the better by this event.\n\nEarlier this year I received one of the highest honours of my life when I was invited to participate in the live band during the first half, as well as DJ the second half by myself. It was a life-affirming experience. After fantasizing about it for years I was finally able to share some of my favorite music with some of my favorite people. If you\u2019re interested you can listen to the first half of my DJ set on my SoundCloud.\n\nI have been invited to do it again on Sat, Nov 15.\n\nThis edition, we are exploring Death, through the changing of the seasons, loss of loved ones, and rebirth.\n\nWe would be honoured if you joined us.\n\nMessage me to learn the address and find out more.",
